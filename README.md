# VoxelDevScripts
A collection of small functions/algorithms particularily useful for voxel game dev. Code will usually be in C++ and may or may not compile in C. 

If you find any of this useful, feel free to copy&paste, there's no need to credit or anything like that. 

If you find any bugs, please let me know so I can fix it :)
